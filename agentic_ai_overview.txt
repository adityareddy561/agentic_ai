Agentic AI Overview
---------------------
Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to operate autonomously as agents that can plan, reason, and execute tasks with minimal human intervention. 
These systems leverage large language models (LLMs), orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, and vector databases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Key Features:
- Autonomous task execution
- Context-aware decision making
- Integration with APIs and external tools
- Dynamic planning and memory

Popular Tools & Frameworks:
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- Pinecone
- Weaviate

Use Cases:
- Automated customer support
- Complex data extraction
- Knowledge base querying with RAG
- Workflow automation and multi-agent collaboration

Agentic AI represents the next evolution of intelligent systems that go beyond static prompt-response models, enabling businesses to unlock new levels of productivity.
